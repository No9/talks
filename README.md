# Submitting a talk to SquatConf, a different experience ...

Submitting a talk to squatconf is a different experience, Usually, you cross your finger hoping to be accepted, an audience, a different place, some good peoples is not a bad thing, hey ?  
SquatConf will be providing all of that, sort of ... and a lot more ... in a different package

## Disclaimer

all talks are welcome, but we are not really here to promote "how we X helped the company Y to become the biggest in Z", we are here to have some good conversation about exiting technologies, with an emphasis on the one that free our minds.

In the talk proposal we are asking if you can offord to advance the price of your trip, this is not mandatory, nor a no go for a talk, but due to the format of the conference, your trip may not be refunded, this is an experience, it is up to you if you want to try it, we are NOT LOOKING FOR COMPANY PAID TRIPS, unless they expect noting out of it, except helping you giving a talk where they are not mentioned nor related but in an interesting place

You will more likely be hosted by some Parisians, they usually don't bite, but drink (and share) lots of wine, cheese, and do not have a room service.
